# SieveOfErathosthenes
For finding or counting prime numbers in O(LOG(LOG N)) time.
The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all primes smaller than n when n is smaller than 10 million or so.
Following is the algorithm to find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by the Eratostheneâ€™s method: 
When the algorithm terminates, all the numbers in the list that are not marked are prime.
